# mie424-project

Experiments were run on three papers relevant to fairness: “Too Relaxed to Be Fair” (Lohaus et al.), “Mechanisms of Fair Classification” (Zafar et al.), and “Two-Player Games for Efficient Non-Convex Constrained Optimization” (Cotter et al.) on two different datasets: 1) a Recidivism dataset and 2) an Adult dataset for classifying annual income as high/low. These experiments can be seen at the following directories and files:

### Too Relaxed to Be Fair

Code related to this paper can be found in this repo at [SearchFair-master/](SearchFair-master/)

Experiments on the recidivism dataset can be found at [SearchFair-master/examples/real_data - recidivism.ipynb](<SearchFair-master/examples/real_data - recidivism.ipynb>)

Experiments on the adult dataset can be found at [SearchFair-master/examples/real_data.ipynb](SearchFair-master/examples/real_data.ipynb)

### Mechanisms of Fair Classification

Code related to this paper can be found in this repo at [Linear Relaxation/disparate_impact/](<Linear Relaxation/disparate_impact/>)

The README in the above directory will guide you on where to find the experiments for each of the Recidivism and Adult datasets.
