# Classification without disparate impact

## File Structure

The `fair_classification` directory holds the majority of the helper functions that are used to create the models, perform the training, and evalute the models. Included in here are the hardcoded loss functions used for the baseline models.

The `adult_data_demo` directory holds the scripts that were used to prepare the adult data and create, train and test a model with the adult data.

The `recidivism_data_demo` directory holds the scripts that were used to prepare the recidivism data and create, train and test a model with the recidivism data.

## Running the Code
To run the scripts, type in `python demo_constraints.py` in the directory for each of the datasets.
